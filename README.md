## Notes

* I know some of the naming conventions in this project is inconsistent (e.g., `fooBar` and `foo_bar`). But everything works, and they are subject for changes. So just bear with me for now, **thank you very much**.
* However I do like to keep the code structured and well-formated, you should use `xmake format` every time before commit.
